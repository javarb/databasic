- JUnit
- Git & GitHub
- Markdown
- Software Design
- Clear technical communication
- StackOverflow to find answers to questions
- Library documentation
- Javadoc
- Unix command line basics
- Object Oriented Design
- JSON
- Technical development practices
  - Refactoring
  - TDD
  - Clean Code
  - Clean Architecture

- Delete all but the first line of this README, and push.
- Create a simple Java project through IntelliJ
- Make and massage your project's .gitignore file.
- Requirements gathering
- Design from requirements
- Learn the importance of feedback
- Start naive implementation
- Revisit naive implementation and the review experience
- Kill the naive implementation with experience, and without pride.
- Refactoring - when is it OK to start over?
- Introducing JUnit
- New requirements gathering
- Less naive implementation in your own time

## Process

### Do

- Learn the practices and processes with help from [me](https://github.com/kinbiko) during the guided sessions.
- Practice in your own time by completing the challenge given for each lesson.
    - If you get stuck (for more than 5 non-consecutive hours of intensive study) create an issue on this repo, and I'll have a look.
- Create a PR to this repo for review after each lesson. The PR will be closed once any review comments have been addressed. The PR will not be merged as I use this repo to teach multiple people.
- Schedule your next lesson when you feel you need it. The lesson plan is a finger-in-the-air best case scenario, and I am more than happy to repeat any previous topcis. If you ever feel behind on anything then that's my fault for giving a bad estimate - not yours.
- Maintain a notebook of glossary and what you've learned. I am happy to review this for you as well. This repo will not contain much technical information.
- Refer back to the [original README](https://github.com/kinbiko/databasic) regularly to check for updates.
- Suggest improvements you want from these lessons in the form of GitHub issues on this repo.

### Don't do

- Don't look at other forks of this repo for a solution to your problem. This isn't work; The metric of success is not business value or time. This isn't school; The metric of success is not a grade. The metric of success is ambiguous, but undeniable, and it is *experience*. Which comes from being stuck and making bad choices. Get stuck. Make bad choices.
